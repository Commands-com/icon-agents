# Icon Security Review

Intelligent security analysis that automatically selects the most relevant legendary security experts based on your project characteristics and security concerns. Executes selected experts in parallel for comprehensive security assessment.

## Available Security Experts

**8 Legendary Security Experts:**
- **Dan Kaminsky**: DNS security, infrastructure vulnerabilities, responsible disclosure
- **Katie Moussouris**: Vulnerability management, bug bounty programs, coordinated disclosure
- **Bruce Schneier**: Cryptography, security analysis, privacy, and security economics
- **Mikko Hypp√∂nen**: Malware analysis, threat intelligence, digital privacy advocacy
- **Tarah Wheeler**: Cybersecurity policy, international cyber norms, inclusive security
- **Mudge Zatko**: Security research, vulnerability discovery, security culture transformation
- **Eva Galperin**: Digital rights, stalkerware research, vulnerable population protection
- **Moxie Marlinspike**: Applied cryptography, Signal protocol, usable encryption

## Security Analysis Process

### 1. **Gather Git Context**
- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

### 2. **Security Context Gathering**

I'll analyze your project for security characteristics:

**Technology Stack Security Analysis:**
- Web application frameworks and security patterns
- Cryptographic libraries and implementations
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Data handling and storage security
- Network communication security

**Git Changes Security Review (if applicable):**
- Security-relevant code changes
- Authentication/authorization modifications
- Cryptographic implementation changes
- Input validation and sanitization updates

### 3. **Intelligent Security Expert Selection**

Based on project analysis, I'll select 2-4 most relevant security experts:

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Cryptography focus** ‚Üí Bruce Schneier + Moxie Marlinspike
- **Web application security** ‚Üí Mudge Zatko + Katie Moussouris  
- **Infrastructure security** ‚Üí Dan Kaminsky + Mikko Hypp√∂nen
- **Policy and governance** ‚Üí Tarah Wheeler + Eva Galperin
- **Threat intelligence** ‚Üí Mikko Hypp√∂nen + Dan Kaminsky
- **Vulnerability management** ‚Üí Katie Moussouris + Mudge Zatko

### 3. **Parallel Security Expert Execution**

Selected experts analyze simultaneously:

```
<function_calls>
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">[selected-security-expert-1]</parameter>
<parameter name="description">[Expert] security analysis</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">Analyze this project from your security expertise perspective.

Project Context:
[PROJECT_STRUCTURE_AND_SECURITY_PATTERNS]

Git Changes (if applicable):

Focus on your core security expertise:
[EXPERT_SPECIFIC_SECURITY_FOCUS]

Provide security analysis with concrete, actionable recommendations.</parameter>
</invoke>
[Additional security experts in parallel...]
</function_calls>
```

**Benefits of Parallel Security Analysis:**
- **Comprehensive**: Multiple security perspectives simultaneously
- **Fast**: Parallel execution (up to 4x faster than sequential)
- **Specialized**: Each expert applies their specific security domain
- **Thorough**: Different security concerns covered by different experts
