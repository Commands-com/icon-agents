# Icon Platform & Operations Review

Intelligent platform and operations analysis that automatically selects the most relevant legendary infrastructure and platform experts.

## Available Platform & Operations Experts

**8 Legendary Infrastructure Experts:**
- **Tim Berners-Lee**: Web architecture, open standards, decentralization
- **Vint Cerf**: Internet protocols, end-to-end connectivity, global networking
- **Radia Perlman**: Network engineering, fault tolerance, self-healing networks
- **Werner Vogels**: Cloud architecture, distributed systems, eventual consistency
- **Martin Fowler**: Enterprise architecture, evolutionary design, microservices
- **Brendan Gregg**: Performance engineering, systems observability, optimization
- **Kelsey Hightower**: Cloud native, Kubernetes, developer experience
- **Jessie Frazelle**: Systems security, container security, kernel internals

## Analysis Process

### 1. **Gather Git Context**
- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

### 2. **Platform & Operations Analysis**

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Cloud Architecture** → Werner Vogels + Kelsey Hightower
- **Performance** → Brendan Gregg + Werner Vogels
- **Network Infrastructure** → Vint Cerf + Radia Perlman
- **Container/Security** → Jessie Frazelle + Kelsey Hightower
- **Enterprise Architecture** → Martin Fowler + Tim Berners-Lee

This command provides focused platform and operations expertise.
