# Icon Expert Review

## Overview

The Icon Expert Review command represents the unified solution recommended by the legendary programming trio (Linus Torvalds, John Carmack, and Rich Hickey). Instead of complex panel commands with over-parameterization, this single intelligent command analyzes your problem and automatically selects the most relevant programming experts.

## Key Benefits

### üß† **Intelligent Expert Selection**
- Automatically analyzes your problem to select the right experts
- No need to choose between "architecture councils" or "performance tribunals"
- Routes problems to the most qualified legendary programmers

### ‚ö° **Parallel Performance** 
- Multiple experts analyze simultaneously (retained from original design)
- Faster results than sequential expert consultation
- Optimized resource usage (only loads needed experts)

### üéØ **Problem-Focused**
- Understands different problem types automatically
- Routes to appropriate domain experts
- Provides unified, actionable recommendations

## Expert Selection Logic

The system routes problems based on analysis:

| Problem Type | Selected Experts | Why These Experts |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Performance** | Carmack + Knuth | Optimization + Algorithmic analysis |
| **Architecture** | Hickey + Kay + Liskov | Simplicity + Vision + Abstraction |
| **Quality** | Linus + Beck + Lamport | Engineering taste + TDD + Correctness |
| **Complex** | Intelligent combination | Multiple domains require multiple experts |

## Usage Examples

### Performance Analysis
```bash
/icon-expert-review "This function is slow and causing bottlenecks"
```
‚Üí Automatically routes to **Carmack** (optimization) + **Knuth** (algorithms)

### Architecture Review  
```bash
/icon-expert-review "Need to redesign this complex system architecture"
```
‚Üí Automatically routes to **Hickey** (simplicity) + **Kay** (evolution) + **Liskov** (abstraction)

### Code Quality Review
```bash
/icon-expert-review "This code has quality issues and needs testing"
```
‚Üí Automatically routes to **Linus** (taste) + **Beck** (TDD) + **Lamport** (correctness)

### Commit Review
```bash
/icon-commit-review
```
‚Üí Intelligently selects experts based on the actual changes in your commits

## Parameters

### Simple Interface (Legendary Consensus)
- **`source`** (required): File path, GitHub URL, or problem description
- **`focus`** (optional): Override expert selection - "performance", "architecture", "quality", "all"

### Power User Overrides
- **`experts`** (optional): Manually specify experts like "linus,carmack,hickey"
- **`detail_level`** (optional): "quick", "standard", "comprehensive"

## Implementation Philosophy

This command implements the unified solution recommended by all three legendary programmers:

### üêß **Linus Torvalds**: *"Stop making users choose committees"*
- Single command with intelligent defaults
- No bureaucratic naming or over-parameterization
- Focus on solving real problems, not sounding impressive

### üöÄ **John Carmack**: *"Only load what you need, when you need it"*
- Resource-efficient expert selection
- Parallel execution where it matters
- Performance optimization based on actual usage patterns

### üß† **Rich Hickey**: *"Separate expert knowledge from coordination complexity"*
- Simple interface hiding complex expert selection logic
- No complecting of expert analysis with execution machinery
- Pure function: problem ‚Üí relevant expert insights

## Output Quality

Expect focused, actionable insights from the world's most legendary programmers, automatically selected for your specific problem and delivered in parallel for optimal performance.
