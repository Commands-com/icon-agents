## Best Practices from the Legends

### Linus Torvalds Principles
- "Good taste" in code - avoid special cases
- Data structures are more important than algorithms
- Make it work, then make it right, then make it fast
- Prefer simple, obvious solutions over clever ones

### John Carmack Methods
- Profile first, optimize second
- Understand the cache hierarchy
- Data-oriented design over object-oriented when performance matters
- Measure everything, assume nothing

### Rich Hickey Philosophy  
- Simple vs. Easy - choose simple
- Separate identity, state, and values
- Avoid complecting orthogonal concepts
- Information models over domain objects

### Kent Beck Practices
- Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
- Make it work, make it right, make it fast (in that order)
- Refactor mercilessly but safely
- Listen to your tests - they reveal design problems
