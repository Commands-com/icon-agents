## üß† How It Works

### **Intelligent Expert Selection**
No more choosing between experts or running all of them. The system:
1. **Analyzes your problem** using direct LLM intelligence (no fragile keyword matching)
2. **Selects 2-3 most relevant experts** from the appropriate domain(s)
3. **Executes in parallel** for fast, comprehensive analysis
4. **Synthesizes results** into unified, actionable recommendations

### **Example Analysis Flow**
```
Your Input: "Slow database queries in our microservices architecture"

AI Analysis: 
- Primary domain: Performance + Architecture + Platform
- Selected experts: John Carmack (performance), Rich Hickey (architecture), Werner Vogels (distributed systems)

Parallel Execution:
üöÄ Carmack analyzes query optimization and caching strategies
üß† Hickey examines architectural complexity and data flow
‚òÅÔ∏è Vogels reviews distributed system patterns and consistency

Unified Output: Concrete recommendations with priority levels
```

## üìã Usage Examples

### **Multi-Domain Analysis**
```bash
/icon-review
# Analyzes your project and automatically selects relevant experts across all domains
```

### **Domain-Specific Analysis**
```bash
/icon-programming-review --source ./src/performance-critical.js
# Focus on programming expertise for code analysis

/icon-security-review --source ./auth-module/
# Security-focused analysis of authentication code

/icon-design-review --source ./mockups/user-flow.figma
# Design analysis of user experience flows
```

### **Individual Expert Consultation**
```bash
# Direct expert access via Task agents
Task(linus-torvalds): "Review this data structure design"
Task(john-carmack): "Analyze these performance bottlenecks"
Task(rich-hickey): "Evaluate this architecture for simplicity"
```

## üéõÔ∏è Installation Options
