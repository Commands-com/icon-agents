# Icon Design Review

Intelligent design analysis that automatically selects the most relevant legendary design experts based on your project's design challenges and user experience needs. Executes selected experts in parallel for comprehensive design assessment.

## Available Design Masters

**8 Legendary Design Experts:**
- **Dieter Rams**: Minimalist design principles, timeless aesthetics, sustainable design
- **Don Norman**: Human-centered design, usability principles, cognitive psychology
- **Edward Tufte**: Data visualization excellence, information design, analytical graphics
- **Jonathan Ive**: Industrial design, material innovation, integrated design thinking
- **Susan Kare**: Icon design, visual communication, interface symbolism
- **Jakob Nielsen**: Usability engineering, heuristic evaluation, interface optimization
- **Kat Holmes**: Inclusive design, accessibility excellence, universal design principles
- **Lou Downe**: Service design, end-to-end user experiences, holistic design thinking

## Design Analysis Process

### 1. **Gather Git Context**
- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

### 2. **Design Context Gathering**

I'll analyze your project for design characteristics:

**Interface and Visual Design Analysis:**
- UI components and design patterns
- Visual hierarchy and typography
- Color schemes and accessibility
- Icon systems and visual language
- Responsive design implementation

**User Experience Analysis:**
- User flows and interaction patterns
- Information architecture
- Navigation and wayfinding
- Form design and input patterns
- Error states and feedback systems

**Design System Analysis:**
- Component consistency and reusability
- Design token usage
- Brand consistency
- Documentation and guidelines

### 3. **Intelligent Design Expert Selection**

Based on project analysis, I'll select 2-4 most relevant design experts:

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Minimalist/Clean Design** ‚Üí Dieter Rams + Jonathan Ive
- **Usability Issues** ‚Üí Don Norman + Jakob Nielsen
- **Data Visualization** ‚Üí Edward Tufte + Don Norman
- **Icon/Visual Communication** ‚Üí Susan Kare + Dieter Rams
- **Accessibility Concerns** ‚Üí Kat Holmes + Don Norman
- **Service Design** ‚Üí Lou Downe + Kat Holmes
- **Mobile/Product Design** ‚Üí Jonathan Ive + Don Norman

### 3. **Parallel Design Expert Execution**

Selected experts analyze simultaneously:

```
