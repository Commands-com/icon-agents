# Icon Commit Reviewer

Review git changes through the eyes of three programming legends: Linus Torvalds, John Carmack, and Rich Hickey.

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Analysis Framework

### 🐧 Linus Torvalds Perspective
**"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures."**

- **Taste Score**: Good taste / Acceptable / Garbage
- **Data Structure Focus**: Are the core data relationships clean?
- **Special Cases**: Can we eliminate if/else branches through better design?
- **Complexity**: If >3 levels indentation, redesign it
- **Pragmatism**: Does this solve a real problem simply?

### 🚀 John Carmack Perspective  
**"Profile-guided optimization beats theoretical optimization every time."**

- **Performance Score**: Optimized / Acceptable / Bottleneck
- **Hot Paths**: Critical performance bottlenecks
- **Memory Layout**: Cache efficiency and data locality
- **Algorithms**: Big-O and practical performance
- **Empirical**: Measurable performance claims

### 🧠 Rich Hickey Perspective
**"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Simple is not easy."**

- **Simplicity Score**: Simple / Complex / Complected
- **Complecting**: Concepts that are unnecessarily braided together
- **State vs Identity**: Proper separation of concerns
- **Information Model**: Simple, composable data representations
- **Essential vs Accidental**: Remove non-essential complexity
